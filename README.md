# Data Analysis Project - Predicting Career Outcomes for Computer Science Students

## Course Information
- **Course Name**: CKCS149 DCY - Python Programming
- **Semester**: P2024
- **Institution**: Toronto Metropolitan University
- **Lecturer**: Dr. Mihal Miu
- **Student**: Rolex Antoine Alexander

## Project Overview

This project is part of the final assessment for the CKCS149 DCY - Python Programming course. The primary objective is to apply data analysis techniques to predict the future career paths of computer science students based on various factors such as GPA, programming skills, and project experience. The analysis also explores gender-based trends and the impact of project experience on career outcomes.

### Key Objectives
1. **Predict Future Career Paths**: 
   - Analyze key metrics such as GPA, programming language proficiency, and interested domains to predict the most likely career outcomes for computer science students.
   
2. **Analyze the Impact of Project Experience**:
   - Investigate how the type and number of projects completed by students influence their career paths, identifying the importance of practical experience in career development.
   
3. **Examine Gender-Based Career Trends**:
   - Explore potential gender-based trends in career outcomes to identify if certain career paths are more common among male or female students.

## Dataset

### Source
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle and was sourced from the following link:
- **Kaggle Dataset**: [Computer Science Students Career Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devildyno/computer-science-students-career-prediction)

### Data Description
The dataset contains information on computer science students, including:
- Student ID
- Name
- Gender
- Age
- GPA
- Major
- Interested Domain
- Completed Projects
- Proficiency in Programming Languages (Python, SQL, Java)
- Future Career Path

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and evaluating the predictive model.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand the distribution of features and their relationships with career outcomes.
3. **Modeling**: Using a Random Forest Classifier to predict career paths based on the provided features.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization**: Creating graphs and charts to illustrate the impact of project experience and gender-based trends on career outcomes.

## Findings

### Key Findings
1. **Future Career Path Prediction**: The model achieved an accuracy of 86%, effectively predicting the career paths for most students based on the provided features.
2. **Impact of Project Experience**: The analysis revealed that students typically complete projects in areas related to their desired career paths, giving them an advantage in securing relevant employment.
3. **Gender-Based Trends**: While no significant gender-based trends were identified, the data showed that a majority of male students pursued careers as Software Engineers.

## Conclusion

The project successfully met its objectives by leveraging data analysis techniques to predict career outcomes for computer science students. The findings provide valuable insights into the importance of GPA, project experience, and interested domains in shaping students' career trajectories. These insights can be utilized to improve career counseling and educational strategies, ensuring students are better prepared for their future careers.
